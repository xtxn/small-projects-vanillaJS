# An infinite scroll image gallery using Unsplash API

The core feature is an infinite scroll gallery that provides a continuous, uninterrupted flow of images fetched directly from the Unsplash API. As the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page, new images are dynamically fetched and added to the grid. <br>
I implemented the infinity scroll using the **Intersection Observer API** instead of using scroll event listener.
An empty div is placed at the end of the image list and is used as a trigger for the observer.
